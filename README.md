# PartyLaps
A fork of the MultiLaps mod for Assetto Corsa to better support multiple drivers hotlapping on a single machine.

This project aims to add the following features to MultiLaps:

* The ability to provide a list of drivers using the config app.
* The ability to change the currently lapping driver through the main app.
* Record best lap times and delta information per unique driver.
* Record best lap time and delta information for the current session.
* A new app to display the current best lap delta, best personal delta, best session delta. best personal session delta.
* Display some derivative of the deltas above to indicate if the driver recently gained or lost on them.

The primary motivation for adding all of the above scope into this app is that MultiLaps is seemingly the only mod which correctly calculates deltas over all AC tracks, including the Nordschleife Tourist variant.
